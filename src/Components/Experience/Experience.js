          After finishing grad school, I ended up volunteering to teach English
          to high school students in rural (by Chinese standards) China for a
          year. I ended up loving it and found another job teaching English to
          high school students in Shanghai for 6 months.

          On my return from China, I worked several part-time and temporary
          positions while looking for my next full time role. I was an SAT prep
          teacher, an administrative assistant for a YMCA summer camp, and an
          administrative assistant for a small edtech startup.

          I eventually landed a position as a life skills staff for the College
          Internship Program (CIP). They work with young adults with high
          functioning Autism helping to prepare them to live on their own. I
          would help students creating schedules and teach them how to cook,
          clean, grocery shop, and general executive functioning skills that
          they would need to be successful living on their own in the future.

          After 6 months, I ran CIP's summer program for high school students. I
          coordinated events and staff and made sure to communicate students'
          needs to staff and their parents as needed. After that, I was promoted
          to the Graduate Living Community Coordinator position. This was a new
          program that worked with students that were ready to transition out of
          our programs to fully living on their own. I would work with students
          individually and in groups to identify their goals and work on the
          skills to reach those goals.

          I found the work at CIP wasn't a good fit for me and I also wanted to
          make a big change with my life. I moved to Denver and ended up getting
          a job at Easton Training Center as a first impressions specialist. I
          worked the front desk, checking in members, selling memberships,
          selling gear, and maintaining positive relationships with members. I
          was promoted several times and ended up as the Academy Operations
          Director, where I was responsible for a front desk staff of 3,
          overseeing sales and sales training, and general day-to-day operations
          of our location. During my time there, memberships grew by 25% and
          front desk operations were streamlined.
